Aspiring software developer with a keen interest in Data Science. Learning is a big passion of
mine and that has been supplemented by my affection for reading non-fiction books. At the time of writing this, I am
a second year student in the process of acquiring my bachelors in Information Systems.
I have also taken a 6-month bootcamp that has introduced me to the Data Science concepts I am now fond of. I must admit,
the learning curve has been somewhat steep though I hope to have these concepts come to me as second naure in the near future
with more Data Science related projects and activities. As mentioned earlier, I am very passionate about reading, and through
reading, my interest in learning has developed. I am a firm believer that any human can learn anything and have thus made it my
mission to seek and learn knowledge regardless of how daunting the task ahead might be. 

Through my software developer skills, I hope to one day run or manage a large enterprise that provides IT solutions to other 
organisations. A big motivator in my quest to engage in the world of Data Science stems from my childhood. I one day dream of 
developing an android that is powered by artifical intelligence. A feat that will prove almost impossible, yet very rewarding.

Sentiment Analysis:
A python programme written by using the Tensorflow API, Keras, to build a Recurrent Neural Network that classifies Amazon book
reviews as either positive or negative. One of my personal favourites! The code can be found in my repository.
